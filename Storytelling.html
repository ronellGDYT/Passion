        <h2> My Passion is Creative Writing </h2>
        <p> Im passionate about it because I love being imaginative and creative and creating my own worlds and characters and storylines and allowing them to branch out </p>
        <p> I was introduced to it through a video game back in 2009, I loved the storyline and it made me want to start creatively writing my own stories similar to that game </p>
        <p> Overall, video games and movies served as the biggest inspiration to me in the beginning </p>
        <p> As of now, the media that I consume, from video games, movies, TV shows, books, music, etc, are the things that continue to inspire me to create my own stories </p>
