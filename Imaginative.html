My passion is Storytelling/Writing
Im passionate about it because I love being imaginative and creative and creating my own worlds and characters and storylines and allowing them to branch out
I was introduced to it through a video game back in 2009, I loved the storyline and it made me want to start creatively writing my own stories similar to that game
Overall, video games and movies served as the biggest inspiration to me in the beginning
As of now, the media that I consume, from video games, movies, TV shows, books, music, etc, are the things that continue to inspire me to create my own stories
